                I am 22 years old, I am an October baby (October Babies rule!). I enjoy talking, I may look mad or
                pissed
                sometimes but that just my (rest) face but I dont shut up once we start talking. I used to play and
                still
                want to play Futbol, I enjoy swimming but I havent done that in a while. I hate being skinny but Im to
                lazy
                to workout but thats just my depression.

                <p class="solid" id="p2">I suck at tennis but I played for a year sooo yeah, Im a PRO! I love the fall,
                    I
                    think its the best season for indoor and outdoor activities. I love to play video games as well but
                    I
                    havent had the time/money/energy so I just play three to four games. Same goes with movies.
                    I have 2 dogs, one is named sassy and the other is gordo (fat in english). I love my family. My best
                    friend (surprised I have one) is in florida, chasing his dream and I love the fact that he is going
                    for
                    it,
                    his family has always made me feel like a son and brother and I feel blessed for it.
                    Add me in battle.net because Im getting Mordern Warfare and that will the game Ill play for a while!
