                Hello everyone and let me start by first saying thank you
                for taking your time to read my portfolio.
                I am a certified Full-Stack Web developer. However I do perfer 
                working in Front-End. I am hopeful to start my career as a Front-End Web
                Developer. I am looking for a job where I can increase my knowledge and be an
                important member of the company.

                <h2>
                    What do I know?
                </h2>
            </div>
            
            <div class="grid2-4">
                <p>
                    As a Full-Stack Web Developer I am fimiliar with Back-End and Front-End coding.
                    I use mostly html and css with or without frameworks, I am comfortable with JavaScript and Jquery.
                    I am still rough on Back-End. I wish I had more time to work on my skills and increase my knowledge.
                    However I am working full time to pay my bills and I wish I can just get back to this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work I enjoy playing Video Games, playing a few sports (soccer, tennis, 5k's, swimming), I love
                    skydiving and am hopeful that by 2021 I have my license to do solo jumps.
